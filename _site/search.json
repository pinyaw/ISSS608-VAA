Therefore, moving forward analyses conducted after have to take into account of this information.\n\n\nShow the code\neducount &lt;-table(participants_df2$educationLevel)\npercentage_edu &lt;- educount/ sum(educount)\npercentage_edu_labels &lt;- paste0(round(percentage_edu*100),\"%\")\ndf_edu &lt;- data.frame(educount,percentage_edu,percentage_edu_labels)\n\n#Change column names\ncolnames(df_edu)[1] &lt;- \"educationLevel\"\ncolnames(df_edu)[2] &lt;- \"Count\"\ncolnames(df_edu)[3] &lt;- \"educationLevel2\"\ncolnames(df_edu)[4] &lt;- \"percentage_edu\"\n\nfig_edu &lt;- df_edu |&gt; \n  plot_ly() |&gt; \n  add_trace(\n    labels = ~educationLevel,\n    values = ~Count, \n    type = \"pie\") %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Education Level Distribution', plot_bgcolor = \"#e5ecf6\")\nfig_edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Do higher educated participants tend to not have kids?\nIt can be observed that HighSchoolOrCollege have the highest percentage as well as the count for participants who have kids from the provided data. Bachechors and Graduate participants have a slightly higher percentage of haveKids = False within their own groups as compared to the Low education participants.\nFrom the width of the Mosaic plot, HighSchoolOrCollege has the highest participants count and Low education has the least participants. Assuming the participants here are the representation of the whole population of the city, we can conclude that lower education participants indeed have a higher tendency to have kids, while higher qualification participants would weigh in the cost of having kids and hence chose not to have kids.\n\n\nShow the code\nd &lt;- ggplot(participants_df2) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(educationLevel), fill = haveKids)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1.0))\n\nggplotly(d, tooltip =\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Do higher educated participants have a higher wage income?\nTo further understand the demographics of the participants, age groups are being formed such that we can analyse the patterns and trends exhibit by the similar age group of people.\nThe age data provided is in continuous form, therefore the age data is being regrouped into 4 distinct groups.

Judging by the lines of the boxplot, the higher age groups (41 and above) tends to have a lower average of joviality while participating in this survey.

Education cost is only present for participants who have kids. In addition, average monthly Shelter Cost’s Mean and median is also appeared to be higher than for participants who have kids as they need to have a larger space as well as a permanent space for a more comfortable living environment for the kids.\nOn the flip side, the distribution for Food and Recreation Cost seems to be similar. Participants with kids have a higher median for Recreation Cost, most likely due to the additional cost for children (cheaper than an adult) for all the recreational activities. As for Food, not much difference can be observed between participants with or without kids.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Change timestamp to month\ndf_cat1 &lt;- finance_df2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = month(timestamp))\n\n# summation of the amount based on ID and category and month\ndf_cat2 &lt;- df_cat1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(participantId, category, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(sum_amount = sum(amount))\n# To find the monthly average amount\ndf_cat2 &lt;- df_cat2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(participantId, category) %&gt;%\n  summarize(average_amount = mean(sum_amount))\n\n# To exclude Wage and RentAdjustment as they are income\ndf_cat &lt;- df_cat2[!(df_cat2$category %in% c(\"Wage\",\"RentAdjustment\")), ]\n\n# change negative values to positive so as to be able to show the Cost in positive numbers\ndf_cat &lt;- df_cat %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = c(average_amount), .fns = abs))\n\n# Join participant demographic data\njoined_df &lt;- inner_join(participants_df2, df_cat, by = \"participantId\")\n\n#Boxplot\npp &lt;-ggplot(joined_df, aes(x = haveKids, y = average_amount, fill = category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Cost Average Amount\")\nggplotly(pp)%&gt;%layout(boxmode = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWithout the boxmode in ggplotly, the boxplots under each group will be combined together under one line of plot. It would be harder for the readers to have a sense where does the different categories stand. Hence it is necessary to add in the boxmode = \"group\" to have the above view.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Does higher wage earner tend to have a higher cost of living?\nThe below scatter plot showed the best fit line across the distribution. However, we can observe clearly that distribution data points are mainly situated nearer to the lower income section. To further validate this test, correlation coefficient significant test is being carried out at 95% confidence interval.\n\nH0: There is no significant correlation between the variables\n\n\nH1: The correlation between the variables is statistically significant\nFrom a statistical point of view, the p-value computed was less than 0.05, therefore we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and conclude that there is a correlation between wage cost of living. However, the expectation is different as they are negatively correlated. From the data points, it is observed that there are a significant number of residents who are having a higher cost of living despite having a lower wage, while the top wage earners’ cost of living remained below 10000 over the period.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Change timestamp to month\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- finance_df2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = month(timestamp))\n\n# summation of the amount based on ID and category and month\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- df_income_cost1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(participantId, category, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(sum_amount = sum(amount))\n# To find the monthly average amount\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- df_income_cost1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(participantId, category) %&gt;%\n  summarize(average_amount = mean(sum_amount))\n\n# To regroup into Income and Cost\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- df_income_cost1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(Type = case_when(\n    category == \"Wage\" ~ \"Income\",\n    category == \"RentAdjustment\" ~ \"Income\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Cost\"\n  ))\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- subset(df_income_cost1, select = -c(category) )\n\n# to get the total average income and total average cost\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- df_income_cost1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(participantId, Type) %&gt;%\n  summarize(amount = sum(average_amount))\n\n# change negative values to positive so as to be able to show the Cost in positive numbers\ndf_income_cost1 &lt;- df_income_cost1 %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = c(amount), .fns = abs))\n\ndf_income_cost_final &lt;- pivot_wider(df_income_cost1, names_from = Type, values_from = amount, values_fn = sum)\n\n# Perform bivariate test\nfit &lt;- lm(Cost ~ Income, data = df_income_cost_final)\np_val &lt;- summary(fit)$coefficients[2, 4]\n\n# Create scatter plot with regression line and confidence intervals\nggscatter(df_income_cost_final, x = \"Income\", y = \"Cost\", \n          title = \"Relationship between Average Monthly Income and Cost\",\n          add = \"reg.line\", conf.int = TRUE, \n          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = \"pearson\", \n          cor.plot = TRUE, cor.coef.digits = 2) +\n  stat_regline_equation(aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = \"~~~\")),\n                       label.x.npc = 0.5, label.y.npc = 0.98) +\n  labs(x = \"Average Monthly Income\", y = \"Average Monthly Cost\")\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n          #annotate(\"text\", x = 50000, y = 1000, label = paste(\"p-value = \", p_val))\n\n\nTherefore, higher income individuals do not mean they will be spending more, while lower income individuals might have a high cost of living due to the need of supporting his family or with the presence of kids.\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Participants with higher wage income tends to have higher joviality.\nFrom the below scatterplot, it seemed that they are negatively correlated. To further validate this test, correlation coefficient significant test is being carried out at 95% confidence interval.\n\nH0: There is no significant correlation between the variables\n\n\nH1: The correlation between the variables is statistically significant\nThe test has shown a p-value less than 0.05, therefore we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and conclude that there is a linear relationship and a negative correlation between the wage income and joviality.
